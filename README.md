**Ardufocus - The most accurate Open Source focus controller.**

Ardufocus is the only OSS/OSH controller supporting **two independent** focusing motors, **high resolution**
mode allowing **sub Î¼m** movements by step, multiple acceleration profiles and it will never forget your
focuser position between restarts.

# Example configuration: One Motor, 3 buttons, 3 LEDs

The configuration contained in this branch consists of:
 * An A4988 step stick driving a NEMA17 motor, which is directly connected to the focus axle of a INED70 telescope. It is therefore using microstepping
 * Three button switches for controlling the focuser manually
    * One forward, one backward button
    * One button to switch between two speeds.
 * Three LEDs giving feedback, which button was pressed.
